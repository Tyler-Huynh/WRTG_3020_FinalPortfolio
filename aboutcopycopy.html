				<h2>Don't Cry For Help</h2>
				<p>The last piece of writing that I wanted to reflect upon was my comic on the feeling of emptiness, a feeling we as humans often feel, but dont realize the impact of it.</p>
				<p>Throughout this comic there were many strengths, however the ones that stood out the most to me was my linework and the color of my gutters. My linework throughout the comic after switching to a proper drawing program, were more representative of trying to show the emotion of emptiness. The linework representing the shading in the face or even the erratic nature of finding out your mom passed away were some of my biggest strengths. I also believe that the use of gutters within my comic really helped portray the darkness that we often fall into when we feel the feelings that Timmy felt, especially with the realization that his mom passed away. From the transition between lighter gutters to darker gutters to show the transition between the happier moments to the darker moments in his life, showing the different emotions one can feel when something like that happens.</p>
				<p>The most important aspect to me was to be true to the feeling and try to express it as true to the meaning as possible. Being someone who has suffered from it myself, it was important to me to be able to portray the feeling realistically while also trying to educate others on what it was. As it was a feeling, I didnt know had a meaning until I reached college. I felt it important to also not cross boundaries in talking about depression as it is a sensitive topic and different for everyone who feels it. So, I tried to portray the feeling the most common way that I would see it arising based off its scientific definition as well. </p>
				<p>I found the most difficult thing from creating this comic to be figuring out what drawing program to use as I am usually not one to draw. Within my comic there is also a very clear change in quality when drawing the panels and whatnot as I was still in the stage of experimenting with the panel layout and what each panel would hold, even with a draft figured out. The drawing program was also important to me because I wanted to portray the feeling of emptiness accurately and to do so, I had to find a program that I was the most comfortable with, thus I used Procreate.</p>
				<p>This comic can be expanded much farther than just the feeling of emptiness as depression is a massive web of different feelings that can all be expanded on. Depression can also be derived from other feelings such as anxiety and stress. Thus, this comic cant only stop here as depression shouldnt just stop at one feeling since it is something so vast it cant simply fit into one comic.</p>
