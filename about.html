				<h2>The Madness of Uzumaki</h2>
				<p>From the list of writing that I did this semester I chose my first ever piece of writing from this class that sent me down the spiral of analyzing comics for more than just their illustrations. </p>
				<p>
					From this essay the strengths that I saw were the pieces of analyzation I made from his work within his manga, especially with the fantastic linework and composition of his panels. The linework that is done within the pages of Uzumaki are done so intentionally that we as readers often ignore it, as it just molds into the image that we are looking at. His panel bleeds also incorporate his linework to allow for the reader to absorb every bit of detail within the illustration, to feel the emotion that the author intended. The transitions between his panels are something profound, because rather than walking the reader through every step of the manga, he lets the reader fill in missing details. The idea of closure as expanded on by Scott McCloud. 
					</p>
				<p>The things that I found the most important to me was to stay true to the original message he was trying to portray with his linework. Especially in portions of his comic where the linework can change the entire mood of the page, with his use of shading and display of fear. I also found it important to connect these ideas to that of Scott McClouds to analyze it further. These aspects were important as I was not merely just analyzing a manga, but a piece of art something where the author poured, theyre very being into to try and tell a story. </p>
				<p>I struggled however with finding other examples beyond his linework and panel work, where with his lack of use of color, it made it difficult to find other aspects about his manga to analyze. Itos lack of color especially on full bleeds that couldve benefited from it made it difficult to analyze the use of color on certain pages.</p>
				<p>This piece however is something that cannot simply be limited to merely just Uzumaki, but all his works especially those of Tomie or even his shorter stories, where his linework is even more expressive to display a sense of emotion towards the reader. The most significant reactions that I received for this piece of work is the way that I analyzed the manga, bringing out details that we often as readers choose to ignore.</p>
