				<h2>The Sexualization of Our Heroes</h2>
				<p>The next piece of writing that I chose was one of the most important ones that I have ever done, in that it is representative of an industry standard that has been in place for far too long. It is my inquiry article about the sexualization of women within comics. </p>
				<p>The strengths from this essay that I found the most important was my research done on women being represented within comics, especially my research on the parallels between the representation between men and women within comics. For example, within my piece of work I show two parallels between The Incredible Hulk and She-Hulk, both heroes who have the same powers. However, one is shown to have scandalous clothing when she is in her superhero outfit and the other looking rather normal, but without a shirt. I found this to be a strength in my article as it perfectly showed the different ways men and women are portrayed in comics. Another strength that I found was showing the history of the portrayal of women within comics, from the first female superhero Miss. Fury to modern day Wonder Women. The timeline and history of the sexualization of women in comics is one of my strongest strengths within this article.</p>
				<p>The thing that I found the most important to me was as a man myself making sure that within my writing I dont cross certain lines and try to speak on the experiences of women without experiencing them myself. I found this to be important because oftentimes within media, there are people speaking on topics that dont necessarily pertain to them and oftentimes they are the perpetrators of such topics. I made it an importance to not overstep my boundaries and talked about this topic from an academic sense rather than from experience. </p>
				<p>I found the most difficult thing to be finding quantitative data regarding the topic as there wasnt much present besides a few research articles. The topic of the sexualization of women within comics is an issue that does not have much quantitative data without going through every comic to ever be released and analyzing exactly when the portrayal of women was shown. Rather the data that I found was broader, done in a manner that allowed for it to apply to a wider variety of comics. </p>
				<p>This article can be expanded further beyond where it currently is as the sexualization of women does not simply exist merely within comics, but within almost every aspect of society. Whether that be film or even advertisements in Times Square, the sexualization of women and the lack of proper representation in society is evident and apparent. </p>
