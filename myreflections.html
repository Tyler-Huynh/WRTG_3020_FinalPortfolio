				<h2>A Reflection of Myself</h2>
				<p>This past semester has been truly a fantastic learning experience, I have learned who I am as both a reader and a writer. I have developed my writing from something I believe that was already pretty good to great. </p>
				<p>From my pieces of writing that I chose I think that my proudest piece of work would be my article on the Sexualization of Women in comics. I think that this is my strongest piece of work mainly because of the connections that I made from doing the research on this paper to outside sources from my other classes such as sociology. Especially making a connection with Charlotte Gilman a well-known sociologist who speaks on the detrimental effects that society has on the humanity of women. Another reason I chose this piece of writing as my strongest one is because there are many women around me who have inspired me to achieve my goals especially a large majority of the teachers, I have had in the past all being women. I felt by writing this paper and doing the extensive research that I did was fantastic in that I learned even more about the inequality women face daily even in literature.  </p>

				<p>From all the pieces of work that I had my strongest strengths would be the connections that I make from pieces of research or essays of other with the analyzation that I make on the text that I chose. An example of this could be seen in my analysis of Junji Itos manga and the use of his linework of even my article on the sexualization of women in comics. Where I make connections onto how the representation of women in comics is detrimental and has a lasting effect on the minds of young readers. I also think another strength is my creativity with the entirety of my comic Dont Cry for Help being made from past experiences that I have had besides my dad being abusive. Feeling those feelings in the past I have never found an accurate way to represent those feelings until I made that comic. </p>
				<p>There are many ways that I have grown as a writer from the analysis that I do on pieces of text or even the connections that I make between them. However, I think that the biggest way that I have grown would be my passion for the topics that I have chosen. When I wrote papers in the past, I was passionate about the topic, but it was a topic that I had to write a paper about not one I wanted to write one about. From this I still experience many challenges such as keeping to my topic without expanding too broadly beyond what the main idea of my paper is. This, however, is a challenge I wouldnt want to change as I think that when I go deeper of expand broadly outside of my topic, that is where I get the most fruitful ideas from. </p>

				<p>From my portfolio I hope to show that as a writer and a person I am extremely passionate about the things that I believe in and like. Especially topics about the human experience such as depression or even inequality. As these topics have not been talked about too much in mainstream media, I want to learn more about them so that I can hopefully help others. </p>
				<p>There are many goals that I have in life, but I would say that the biggest ones that I have would be to pay my parents back for everything that they have done for me, find some way to help others within technology, and to explore topics with the intention of revealing them to make them more well known. I want to pay my parents back for everything because as immigrants from a foreign country, they sacrificed everything do that both my little sister and I could achieve the dreams that they couldnt. A sacrifice that I have found to be so supreme that I could never even fathom the willpower it took to leave everything you know behind. My second goal is to help people within my major, mainly because I believe that we as humans have a right to help our brethren no matter the cost. As social interaction and warmth that you feel from it, truly is the best human emotion. My last goal of revealing topics that mainstream media or even society have pushed away is because I think that the stigma around mental health and the blatant coverup of inequality is something profound. I believe that we should help everyone through their issues no matter the reason as that simply is the right thing to do. Overall, my goals are goals that allow for me to be able to learn more about myself so that when it matters, I can be selfless for others.</p>
